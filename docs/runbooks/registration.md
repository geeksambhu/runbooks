# Registration Runbook


decide on registration platform (Tito, eventbrite, etc.)

determine ticket types

set up registration platform

- set type of tickets
- set number of tickets for each type

open early bird registration

close early bird registration & open regular registration

order/print badges for pre-registrations

get lanyards from:
- lanyard sponsor
- OR from conferencebadge.com (or wherever the badges come from)
- OR from office supply store or whatever


Have signs on the reg table to explain process to people in line, e.g.

- step 1, do online intake form
- step 2, check in and get badge
- step 3, get lanyard
- step 4, get swag/tshirt/whatever


Set up registration desk:

- set up signs on reg table
- arrange badges (in racks?)
- what about lanyards?  put them on first?  or not?
- arrange t-shirts (see t-shirt plan), probably behind reg desk?
- set up extension cord/powerstrip
- set up check-in station (laptop or ipad or whatever)
- set up printing station for onsite badge printing (printer + laptop)
- have pen + paper to take notes as a backup because there's alway something...
- set up method of communicating with the printing station and tracking badges
  that need to be printed (Google sheet?)


Run reg table:

- only one person should check people in (at least if we use Tito)
- separate person manage handing out t-shirts
- someone needed to man the printing station


During conference, after reg table slows down, can let some ppl go from reg desk

Should keep it constantly manned, though, for late-comers and as info desk.
