# PyTexas Runbooks

This site contains various runbooks and materials detailing how the PyTexas
Foundation runs various events, from meetups to conferences. 

The material on this site is available for everyone to use in organizing their
own events. We are constantly revising the material of this site, so it should
always be considered a "Work in Progress" site.
