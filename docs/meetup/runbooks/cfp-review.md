# Review of new submissions to CFP

Congratulations, someone has submitted to the Call For Proposals (CFP). Here's what to do.

1. Look at the submission and ask the following questions. If you have any questions or doubts about any of these, talk
   about it in the `#organizers-text` Discord channel.
    * **Is this topic a good fit fot the meetup audience?** Talks for the meetup probably should have some sort of wide 
      appeal, and definitely MUST follow the code of conduct guidelines.
    * **Does it feel like this topic could be adequately covered in 30-60 minutes?** Talks shorter than 30 minutes might 
      need to be combined with another shorter talk to make a sufficient meetup out of. Talks longer than 60 minutes
      run the risk of a lot of attendence drop-off.
    * **Does the submission give you the impression that the speaker can cover the topic?** This might be very hard from 
      to tell from just the submission, but if you have any concern, it may be a good idea to reach out to the speaker 
      with some questions.
    * **Does the submission feel like its goal is advertise a paid product?** If so, we may not want to approve it. The
      dividing line comes down to the "primary purpose" of the talk. If it feels like the main goal is to illustrate 
      some language feature, technique, pattern, library, or something else; and happens to use a paid product, then it
      is probably fine. If it feels like the focus of the talk is the paid product, then it is probably not fine.
2. Assuming the talk has not been rejected, identify a month for the speaker to present in.
3. Contact the speaker and confirm that they are available to speak during the selected month. Have them fill out the 
  [Speaker Intake Form](https://forms.gle/wTkPDH5k4oeLC45z9).

When the speaker's month arrives, update the PyTexas Meetup website with the information.
